flashhang utilizes custom ‘compromise algorithms’ to allow for instant group hang-outs that balance users’ preferences, location, budget, and previous interactions. The app ‘game-ifies’ participation and rewards verbal communication and exploration. On the backend, flashhang leverages large API databases to provide real time event and transportation data.
